## What is Cloud Native DevOps?

Based on the name, Cloud Native DevOps may seem to running containerized application in the cloud, But it's more then that.

### Cloud Native DevOps = Cloud Native apps + DevOps.

Cloud Native DevOps is a method to structure your teams to take advantage of Automation and Scalability that Cloud Native technologies like containers and Kubernetes offer.

Cloud Native technologies are designed to be:

1. **Resilient.** Embracing failures instead of trying to prevent them, taking advantage of the dynamic nature of running on a platform.
2. **Agile.** Allowing for fast deployments and quick iterations.
3. **Operable.** Adding control of application life cycles from inside the application instead of relying on external processes and monitors.
4. **Observable.** Providing information to answer questions about the application state.

#### We can define Cloud Native DevOps as a set of practices that involves continuous improvement, automation, cross-functional teams, better alignment with business needs.

These principles apply to people, tools, culture, and process, not on the actual application env cloud or on-prem, apps can be on public cloud, private cloud or on-prem, end gole to achieve scalable, reliable and high available system by construction.

### How to implement Cloud Native DevOps?

1. Adopt Microservices Patterns
2. Using Containerization
3. Adopt Container Orchestration - Kubernetes
4. Write 12-factor Apps
5. Increase Automation in CI/CD pipelines
6. Exposing health check
7. Collecting telemetry data

### What are advantages of Cloud Native DevOps?

1. Lowering the cloud costs
2. Faster deployments
3. Better control over IT resources
4. Achieving true DevOps
5. Speedy innovation and Scalability

### what are Cloud Native DevOps Process & tools?

1. Source Code Management (SCM)
2. Container Registry
3. Orchestration and Schedulers
4. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment(CI/CD)
5. Observability and Analysis - Monitoring 
6. Observability and Analysis - Logging
7. Provisioning - Security & Compliance
8. Storage/Volume Management
9. Networking
10. Service Discovery
11. Orchestration & Management - Service Mesh
12. Provisioning - Automation & Configuration 
13. Builds and Management

### 1. Source Code Management (SCM)
SCM tool selection is the first step in Cloud Native DevOps or any DevOps Process. My Suggestion will be go with the GIT based SCM system. these days GIT based system are very populer. You have follow option as persent in the marker.

* Github
* Gitlab
* Bitbucket
* AWS CodeCommit
* PreForce
* Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (VSTFS)
* Mercurial 
* Subversion (SVN)
* CVS

Above source code management systems can be used as
* Hosted system like Github, Gitlab or bitbucket
* Self Hosted systems like Gitlab etc.


### 2. Container Registry
You have develped your application as microservices so you need any container tool like Docker to deliver your application, while using Docker you will create Docker Images, So you will need Container Registry system to store you images.

You can assume container registry system same like your source code management tools where you can host you source code, in simmiler manner you can store you docker images on following Container Registry. 

* Docker Registry/DockerHub form Docker
* Harbor - open source - Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
* Quay form Red Hat
* Gitlab Container Registry
* JFrog Artifactory form JFrog
* Portus form SUSE Linux
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) form Amazon Web Services
* Google Container Registry form Google
* Azure Registry form Microsoft
* IBM Cloud Container Registry form IBM
* DigitalOcean Container Registry
* Alibaba Cloud Container Registry

### 3. Orchestration and Schedulers
Kubernetes is one of the most used and populer tool to adopt as orchestration system form Google and now managed by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). There are few more tools you can find below in the image like 
* Docker Swarm form Docker
* Open Shift form Redhat
* Marathon
* Diego form Pivotal Cloud Foundry

### 4. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment(CI/CD)

Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment is the core process of DevOps, The tools who provide unlimited capability in pipeline automation, speed of continuous integration system and super fast continuous deployment to the staging/production systems are very critical. These CI/CD systems plays a vital role while adopting and getting team success in  Cloud Native DevOps.
