<p>Based on the name, cloud native DevOps may seem to running containerized application in the cloud</p>

<p>Cloud Native DevOps is a method to structure your teams to take advantage of the automation and scalability that cloud native technologies like containers and Kubernetes offer</p>

<h3 id="cloud-native-devops--cloud-native-apps--devops">cloud native DevOps = cloud native apps + DevOps.</h3>

<p>Cloud native technologies are designed to be:</p>

<p>Resilient.Â Embracing failures instead of trying to prevent them, taking advantage of the dynamic nature of running on a platform.</p>

<p>Agile.Â Allowing for fast deployments and quick iterations.</p>

<p>Operable.Â Adding control of application life cycles from inside the application instead of relying on external processes and monitors.</p>

<p>Observable. Providing information to answer questions about the application state.</p>

<h4 id="we-can-define-cloud-native-devops-as-a-set-of-practices-that-involves-continuous-improvement-automation-cross-functional-teams-better-alignment-with-business-needs">We can define Cloud Native DevOps as a set of practices that involves continuous improvement, automation, cross-functional teams, better alignment with business needs.</h4>

<p>These principles apply to people, tools, culture, and process, not on the actual application env cloud or on-prem, apps can be on public cloud, private cloud or on-prem, end gole to achieve scalable, reliable and high available system by construction.</p>
