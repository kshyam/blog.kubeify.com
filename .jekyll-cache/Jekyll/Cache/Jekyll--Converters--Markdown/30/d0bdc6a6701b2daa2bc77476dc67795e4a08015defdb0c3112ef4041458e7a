<p>Based on the name, cloud native DevOps may seem to running containerized application in the cloud</p>

<p>Cloud Native DevOps is a method to structure your teams to take advantage of the automation and scalability that cloud native technologies like containers and Kubernetes offer</p>

<h3 id="cloud-native-devops--cloud-native-apps--devops">cloud native DevOps = cloud native apps + DevOps.</h3>

<p>Cloud native technologies are designed to be:</p>

<p>Resilient. Embracing failures instead of trying to prevent them, taking advantage of the dynamic nature of running on a platform.</p>

<p>Agile. Allowing for fast deployments and quick iterations.</p>

<p>Operable. Adding control of application life cycles from inside the application instead of relying on external processes and monitors.</p>

<p>Observable. Providing information to answer questions about the application state.</p>
